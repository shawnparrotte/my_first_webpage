    <h1>So Here Is The Plan</h1>
    <h2>It's not finished quite yet, but that's okay</h2>

    <p>I'm trying to answer a few questions with this undertaking:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How difficult is it to enter a field when you have no experience?</li>
      <li>If you dedicate 4 hours everyday to learning, how much can you learn?</li>
      <li>What does the world really need for it to succeed?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You might say that what I'm up to is a modern version of the Bucky challenge</p>
    <p><strong>How much can one average person do to raise up humanity as a whole?</strong></p>
    <p>Is that too much to take on??</p>
    <p>Maybe I'll try it for a year and see if I can still keep up</p>
